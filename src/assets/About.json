            "My journey in web development began in 2022 when I began studying HTML, CSS and Javascript. Once I had grasped the basics, I transitioned to a React-based workflow.",
            "While working with React, I familiarised myself with concepts such as VDOM manipulation, component re-usability, state management, memoisation and DRY coding.",
            "After creating a few front-end projects in React, I ventured into full-stack territory with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and node.js). Here, I learned more advanced back-end concepts such as authentication, encryption and RESTful API management.",
            "Aside from React, I have also taken on some freelance work as a Wordpress developer, with proficiencies in PHP and custom theme/plugin development.",
            "I am currently in the process of learning C# and ASP.NET as an augmentation of my back-end development capabilities."
